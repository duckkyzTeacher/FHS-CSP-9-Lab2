# Problem 1-3: Adding Docstrings to Functions and Exception Handling
# Write a function called 'circle_area' that calculates the area of a circle given its radius.
# Add a docstring to the function that explains what it does, including parameter details.
# The formula for the area of a circle is: area = pi * radius^2.
#
# After you are sure the function works as expected:
#   Modify the function to raise an exception if a negative radius is provided.
#   If the radius is negative, raise a ValueError with a custom error message.







# Problem 4: Basic Unit Testing
# Write a simple unit test for the 'circle_area' function you just created.
# Ensure that it tests for at least three different radii values.
# Write a test case that deliberately passes a negative value to test the exception handling.
# If you're not familiar with unit testing, simulate testing by calling the function with a few values
# and printing whether the result matches the expected output.
